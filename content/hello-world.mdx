# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog. This is a space where I'll share thoughts on **high-performance computing**, **systems programming**, and whatever else catches my attention.

## Why a blog?

I wanted a place to document things I learn along the way. Writing helps me think more clearly, and maybe it'll help someone else too.

> "The best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else."

## What to expect

Here are some topics I plan to write about:

* Parallel programming with MPI and OpenMP
* GPU computing with CUDA
* Performance profiling and optimization
* Research notes and paper summaries

And in rough priority order:

1. Getting started with HPC clusters
2. Writing efficient C++ for numerical computing
3. Benchmarking and reproducibility tips

## A quick code example

Here's a simple `hello world` in C with MPI:

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    int rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    printf("Hello from rank %d\n", rank);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

Check out the [MPI documentation](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/) for more details.

Stay tuned for more posts!
